# stock_prediction

### Programming language:
Python 3.7.9 with Jupyter Notebook

### Libraries:
Matplotlib, pandas, numpy, datetime, sklearn, Keras, tensorflow

To install Keras and tensorflow on Python, run "pip install Keras" and "pip install --upgrade tensorflow"

### Reproduction of Result:
 1. run "data_preprocessing.ipynb"
 2. run "data_analysis_regression_k_fold_blocking.ipynb"
 3. run "data_analysis_LSTM_blocking.ipynb"

"data_analysis_regression_k_fold_no_blocking.ipynb" and "data_analysis_LSTM_no_blocking.ipynb" are used for experimenting with k-fold blocking and k-fold without blocking. These can also generate forecast results. Running these files for step 2 and 3 will give forecast for k-folds without blocking.
